# Calhm2 Mitochondria Paper

These are the statistics for the CALHM2 mitochondrial paper. The data contains a mix of parametric and non-parametric tests.

## Overview
This repository contains data and R scripts for analyzing the effects of Calhm2 knockdown (KD) on mitochondrial dynamics, focusing on mitochondrial membrane potential and cristae morphology. Our study aims to elucidate the role of Calhm2 in mitochondrial integrity and function.

## Contents
This repository is structured to facilitate easy access to the analysis process and results:
- `Analysis_Script.R`: The primary R script that includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization commands. This script processes raw data from mitochondrial assays and western blots, performs statistical analysis, and generates plots.
- `Data/`: Directory containing raw data files from various mitochondrial assays and western blots. These files are used as input by the `Analysis_Script.R`.
- `Results/`: This directory is automatically generated by the `Analysis_Script.R` and contains all output from the script, including:
  - `Plots/`: Generated images visualizing key findings from the analysis, such as differences in mitochondrial membrane potential and cristae morphology between control and Calhm2 KD groups.
  - `Summary_Statistics.csv`: A CSV file summarizing the statistical analysis results.

## Getting Started
To replicate my analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed (ggplot2, dplyr, etc.).
3. Run the scripts in the `Scripts/` directory in the order specified.

## Analysis Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Statistical Testing**: Includes normality tests, homogeneity tests, and comparison tests (t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests).
3. **Visualization**: Generation of plots to visualize the differences between control and Calhm2 KD groups.
