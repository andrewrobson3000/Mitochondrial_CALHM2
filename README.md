# Calhm2 Mitochondria Paper

These are the statistics for the CALHM2 mitochondrial paper. The data contains a mix of parametric and non-parametric tests.

## Overview
This repository contains data and R scripts for analyzing the effects of Calhm2 knockdown (KD) on mitochondrial dynamics, focusing on mitochondrial membrane potential and cristae morphology. Our study aims to elucidate the role of Calhm2 in mitochondrial integrity and function.

## Contents
This repository contains a comprehensive R file that encompasses the entire analysis workflow for studying the effects of Calhm2 knockdown on mitochondrial function. Here's how everything is organized within the single R file:
- The R files have the following included:
  - **Data Processing:** Code to import and preprocess raw data directly within the script. Note that the raw data might be embedded within the script or accessed through specified paths.
  - **Statistical Analysis:** Performs statistical tests to analyze the impact of Calhm2 knockdown on mitochondrial membrane potential, cristae morphology, and other relevant metrics.
  - **Visualization:** Generates plots and visuals to illustrate the findings. These include graphs of mitochondrial assays, western blots analyses, and other relevant data visualizations.
  - **Results Generation:** Outputs summary statistics and conclusions directly within the script. This may include inline comments or sections dedicated to summarizing the findings.

## Getting Started
To replicate my analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed (ggplot2, dplyr, etc.).
3. Run the scripts in the `Scripts/` directory in the order specified.

## Analysis Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Statistical Testing**: Includes normality tests, homogeneity tests, and comparison tests (t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests).
3. **Visualization**: Generation of plots to visualize the differences between control and Calhm2 KD groups.
