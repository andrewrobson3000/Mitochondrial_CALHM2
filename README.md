# Calhm2 Mitochondria Paper

These are the statistics for the CALHM2 mitochondrial paper. The data contains a mix of parametric and non-parametric tests.

# Comparative Analysis of Calhm2 KD Impact on Mitochondrial Dynamics

## Overview
This repository contains data and R scripts for analyzing the effects of Calhm2 knockdown (KD) on mitochondrial dynamics, focusing on mitochondrial membrane potential and cristae morphology. Our study aims to elucidate the role of Calhm2 in mitochondrial integrity and function.

## Contents
- `Data/`: Raw data files from a range of mitochondrial assays and western blots.
- `Scripts/`: R scripts for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- `Results/`: Generated plots and summary statistics.

## Getting Started
To replicate my analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed (ggplot2, dplyr, etc.).
3. Run the scripts in the `Scripts/` directory in the order specified.

## Analysis Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Statistical Testing**: Includes normality tests, homogeneity tests, and comparison tests (t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests).
3. **Visualization**: Generation of plots to visualize the differences between control and Calhm2 KD groups.

## Acknowledgments
I thank all contributors to this project and the broader scientific community for their interest and engagement with my research.
